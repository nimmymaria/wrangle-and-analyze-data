    "\n",
    "The dataset will be used for wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is that the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also referred to as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs may be a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings nearly always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? nearly always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because \"they're good dogs Brent.\" WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage."

But we, because we've the WeRateDogs Twitter archive and specifically the tweet IDs within it, can gather this data for all 5000+. And guess what?

    "Key points to stay in mind when data wrangling for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.We only want original ratings (no retweets) that have images. Though there are 5000+ tweets within the dataset, not all are dog ratings and a few are retweets.So we want to get the required ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Fully assessing and cleaning the whole dataset requires exceptional effort so only a subset of its issues (eight (8) quality issues and two (2) tidiness issues at minimum) got to be assessed and cleaned.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Cleaning includes merging individual pieces of knowledge consistent with the principles of tidy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.The fact that the rating numerators are greater than the denominators doesn't got to be cleaned. This unique scoring system may be a big a part of the recognition of WeRateDogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.We don't got to gather the tweets beyond August 1st, 2017. We can, but note that we cannot be ready to gather the image predictions for these tweets since we do not have access to the algorithm used."
